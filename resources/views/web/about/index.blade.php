                        <p>"Bookworm is an independent New York bookstore and language school with locations in

                        <h4>Our Story</h4>
                        <p>The name Bookworm was taken from the original name for New York International Airport,
                            which was renamed JFK in December 1963.</p>
                        <p>Our Manhattan store has just moved to the West Village. Our new location is 170 7th Avenue
                            South, at the corner of Perry Street.</p>
                        <p>From March 2008 through May 2016, the store was located in the Flatiron District.</p>

                        <h4>Our Vision</h4>
                        <p>One of the last travel bookstores in the country, our Manhattan store carries a range of
                            guidebooks (all 10% off) to suit the needs and tastes of every traveller and budget.</p>
                        <p>We believe that a novel or travelogue can be just as valuable a key to a place as any guidebook,
                            and our well-read, well-travelled staff is happy to make reading recommendations for any
                            traveller, book lover, or gift giver</p>
